# Mortality Statistics of India
Programming Assignment for the Developing Data Products course offered by Coursera and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

Part1: Shiny Application
____________________________
Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

Part2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation
__________________________________________

5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
Your presentation pushed to github
A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below
Your presentation must satisfy the following

You can filter and view desired data by using control panel located on the left side. Filtered dataset can be downloaded using data tab.

Part 1: Link for the Shiny App for the project is
https://keen23.shinyapps.io/DataProd-MortalityStatistics/
Code for server.R and ui.r is on github


Part 2: Slidify presentaion is also in slidify directory.
